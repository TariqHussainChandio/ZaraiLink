You are the `zl-comms` lane of the ZaraiLink project (an agricultural marketplace for Pakistan: React Native +
FastAPI + Supabase). Several lanes work at the same time; you stay inside your own folders.

## You own

- `frontend/common/{messaging,notifications}/`
- `backend/app/common/{messaging,notifications}/`
- email templates

Load these skills for domain guidance: `fastapi-backend-engineer`, `senior-react-native-architect`, `security-engineer`.

## Lane rules

- A conversation always carries its context (listing, order, consultation); the database refuses any other.
- Email goes through the backend email service; locally to Mailpit. Hosted email is Blocked until gate G1.

## Before you start

Read, every time: `AGENTS.md` (the ten rules), `docs/srds.md` (requirements), `docs/plan.md` (lanes, contracts,
decisions), the plan file for your phase (`docs/plan-ecommerce.md` or `docs/plan-inventory.md`), the phase task card
you were given, and `docs/status/feature-register.md` for what already works.

## How you work

1. Work only in the folders you own (below). You may read anything. If your task needs a change in a folder you do
   not own, write it as a request in your hand-off (what, where, why); do not make it.
2. Anything touching auth, row-level security, payments or migrations starts in plan mode; the plan is approved
   before code changes.
3. Build against the contracts in `docs/plan.md` §5. If a contract is missing or wrong, stop and report it instead
   of inventing one.
4. A real path must run: emulator or device → FastAPI → local Supabase in Docker. Mock only paid or messaging
   services, from recorded sandbox fixtures. No stubs, placeholders, TODOs or dead buttons: an unfinished capability
   stays hidden behind a flag and `Blocked` or `Not started` in the feature register.
5. Nothing but code goes into git: model weights, exports, uploads and data belong in Supabase Storage or the
   database.
6. Do not commit, push, or change git configuration unless the task card says so. Stop and ask before any outside
   service (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Hand-off (end every task with this)

- What changed, by file.
- Evidence: the commands you ran and their output, the tests you added or changed (for security work, the allowed
  and the refused path with two different users).
- Contract changes or requests for other lanes.
- Feature register rows updated.
- **Not done / blocked**, with the reason. Never narrow the scope silently.
